Notes for Start of Class 2.23.21

1. Tell students about How Big is My Browser? Link: http://howbigismybrowser.com/

2. Go over Google Font Process with them. Go to Google Fonts and show then where they can find what I was describing in the Week 2 Homework.

3. Go to CC Search. Go through that process AGAIN.

4. Go to Unsplash. Show them where the attributions are there.

5. Mention that we are going to g  over the  [Images and their backgrounds in HTML5, Relative vs Absolute Paths](https://github.com/interglobalmedia/image-backgrounds-rel-abs-paths) again when we work on the quote page project. But it is a good reference for how to set the size and position of images on a page. Feel free to keep on referring back to it.

6. When we use the figure element along with the figcaption element, it does most of the heavy lifting for us. The only thing to watch out for, is the size of all the images. Especially since we are also using CSS grid for the columns and Flexbox (later on) for the navigation menu and the sticky footer. Unless you are purposely choosing images of differing orientations (prortrait vs landscape) and sizes (like for the Mondrian layout I will mention and demonstrate in a later class), you want your images to have the same or similar orientation (I will explain that) and if not exact same dimensions (w x h) then at least very close. (I will show what happens when that is NOT the case).

7. Show the CSS Grid section on w3schools that they should refer to: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp

8. Show CSS Grid on MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout

9. Refer back to the [Types of Intellectual Property, Images Captioned with Creative Commons Citations ](https://github.com/interglobalmedia/types-of-intellectual-property/blob/master/types-of-intellectual-property.md) for CSS grid explanation.

10. For those who want to get started early, they can refer to my [Basic Responsive Site Navigation](https://github.com/interglobalmedia/basic-responsive-navigation/blob/master/basic-responsive-navigation.md) slide deck to learn how to add Flexbox styling to create a basic responsive navigation with CSS (only). We will be adding a tiny bit of JavaScript later for a responsive hamburger menu in smaller screens (less than 900px). By default, the navigation links are not displayed, but appear when the user clicks on the hamburger menu.

11. For those who want to get started with creating a sticky footer, they can refer to my [Creating a Basic Sticky Footer with CSS](https://github.com/interglobalmedia/basic-sticky-footer/blob/master/basic-sticky-footer.md) slide deck and follow the steps there.

12. Demonstrate how to use the Notes extension for class notes.

And that is it for now!
